Welcome! This is my first blog.

I invite you to join my coding journey in Python. In this blog, I will showcase how Data Science works by projects, how to visualize my insights using python libraries/ Tableau and how to improve the process' performance.
Also, I will tell you my stories in Hyper Island.
Hopefully, you will find something useful from my blog.
