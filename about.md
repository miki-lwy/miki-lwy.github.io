In the beginning of 2020, I have been thinking about what I should do after my second child was born. While taking care of my children, I would like to enhance my programming skills and knowledge of Data Science, Mathematics Statistics, Machine Learning and Data Engineering. 

This is how this blog was born. I will document what I've learnt throughout my studies, including Hyper Island's one. I hope you will enjoy reading my blog.
